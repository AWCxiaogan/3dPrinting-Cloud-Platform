# 3dPrinting-Cloud-Platform

My latest project, which is almost completed.

I was hesitating whether to update my project source code.

But now I am doing it. Because maybe no one will be interested in it.........

But I still update it. If anyone has questions about it, chat with me!

My E-mail is gan_1994@126.com .


Source files are too big.....So, I just upload the most important part, Controller, the "C" in MVC.
